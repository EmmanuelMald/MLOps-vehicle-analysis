# MLOps-vehicle-analysis

The goal of this repository is to create and deploy some ML models that can predict:

- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

- The km/L of a vehicle

Based on some parameters such as fuel type, make, basemodel, etc. Allowing to experiment with personalized vehicles and see how each feature might impact on the car autonomy and CO<sub>2</sub> emission.
