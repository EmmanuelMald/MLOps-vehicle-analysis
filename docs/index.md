# ***Vehicle CO<sub>2</sub> emissions & autonomy estimators***

This repo born from the curiosity of create two machine learning models that can estimate:

- CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (g/km)
- vehicle autonomy (km/L)

of any type of vehicle based on some features such as the make, basemodel, fuel type, vehicle year, among others.

In this aspect, people who wants to buy a car or is interested in this type of information can easily estimate this data, and even testing how this values changes if a piece of the car is modified.

The full project were developed in Python.

- Notebooks are used to develop the models

- Scripts are used for testing

The repository also contains CI/CD pipelines that were implemented using [**Github Actions**](https://docs.github.com/es/actions).
